# Framework for Data and Visual Analytics Lab Experiments üìä

This repository contains lab experiments and a mini-project report for the course **Framework for Data and Visual Analytics (AD23632)**. The content focuses on the core stages of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) and the creation of interactive dashboards using industry-leading Business Intelligence (BI) tools (Power BI, Tableau).

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The experiments are chronologically ordered, covering Python environment setup, EDA fundamentals, and dashboard development.

## ‚ú® Key Learning Outcomes

### 1. Python Environment and EDA Fundamentals

* **Data I/O & Scraping (Exp 02):** Implemented data import from CSV, Excel, and SQL, and successfully performed basic web scraping using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
* **Data Cleaning (Exp 03):** Handled missing data by imputation (mean/mode), removed duplicate rows, and performed data transformation including **Min-Max Scaling** and **Standardization**.
* **Data Inspection (Exp 04):** Performed essential data checks (`.info()`, `.head()`) and calculated descriptive statistics, including **Mean** (e.g., Age: 26.8), **Variance** (e.g., Scores: 94.5), and **Range**.
* **Visualization (Exp 05):** Created fundamental visualizations with **Matplotlib**, such as a Line Chart for daily sales trends and a Bar Chart for average profit by category.

### 2. Business Intelligence Dashboarding

Experiments 06 and 07, along with the Mini-Project, demonstrated proficiency in creating analytical dashboards on the **Sample Superstore Dataset**.

| Tool | Experiment | Key Insights Visualized |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Microsoft Power BI** | 06 & Mini-Project | Visualized Total Sales ($2.30\text{M}$), Total Profit ($286.40\text{K}$), and utilized a Scatter Plot to show the negative relationship between Discount and Profit. |
| **Tableau Desktop** | 07 & Mini-Project | Focused on regional and sub-category profitability, demonstrating the use of calculated fields and interactive filters for deep-dive analysis. |
| **Python Stack** | Mini-Project | Built an interactive web dashboard using **Streamlit
